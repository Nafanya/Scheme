1. Rewrite eval/apply without recursion:

    Program stack must be independent from interpreter stack

2. Add Garbage Collection

3. Rewrite Hash Table implementation:

    Hash function isn't really good

4. Develop more flexible environments for variables

5. Implement all basic Scheme types

6. Develop errors mechanism

8. Add syntactic constructions:

    Detect syntax not in eval

7. Add macro preprocessing
